  Arthur is a year and a half old now and is is a gentle giant who loves
  everyone! His favorite activities include, announcing when he's coming in for
  snuggles, catching any mice that get in, and watching everything that goes on
  out the window.

I found Arthur under my deck at between 3 and 4 weeks old!
