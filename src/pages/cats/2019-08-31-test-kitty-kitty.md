Merlynn is 3 years old and full of personality! I adopted her from friends who were fostering her. As a kitten her favorite pastime was climbing the curtains but as she's officially hitting adulthood she's a lot more chill and chill snuggly, as long as it's on her terms. Favorite activities include playing with a feather copter toy, sunbathing, and waking me up in the middle of the night for pets.
