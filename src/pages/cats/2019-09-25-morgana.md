  Morgana is my youngest, and my very first bottle baby. I pulled her out of my
  wall where she was stuck, alone, and cold at only 8 days old!

Morgana had a bit of a rough start.  She had an eye infection, an upper respiratory infection, coccidia, and possibly feline herpes just 10 days into life but with a little medicine and a lot of TLC she pulled through and is now healthy and almost 5 months old!
