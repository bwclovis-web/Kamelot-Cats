  Lancelot is a Balinese kitty and my only cat ever to have a particular breed.
  After we adopted Merlynn it became clear that she needed a friend, but Merlynn
  is an odd cat so I wanted to make sure I got her a friend she would get along
  with. I did some research and settled on Balinese, and I actually put a
  deposit down before I found either Arthur or Morgana and got educated on
  rescue and the plight of cats. He ended up being the last kitten to be
  officially added to my household though and he ended up becoming best friends
  with Morgana and teaching her how to cat.

Lancelot is now almost 7 months old and he's a sweet, cuddly guy! He has also decided that he's my bathroom buddy. ðŸ˜‚
