description: "After we adopted Merlynn it became clear that she needed a friend, but Merlynn is an odd cat so I wanted to make sure I got her a friend she would get along with. I did some research and settled on Balinese, and I actually put a deposit down before I found either Arthur or Morgana and got educated on rescue and the plight of cats. He ended up being the last kitten to be officially added to my household though and he ended up becoming best friends with Morgana and teaching her how to cat. Lancelot is now almost 7 months old and he's a sweet, cuddly guy! His favorite activities include playing with absolutely anything, grooming Morgana, cuddling and nuzzling my face, cuddling while being groomed (bonus points if we're on the floor) and being my bathroom buddy. \U0001F602"

Lancelot is a Balinese kitty and my only cat ever to have a particular breed.
