It was a rather unusual foster situation because I was fostering for a couple who found him and wanted to keep him, but didn't have enough time to bottle feed a kitten. So I only had him for about 2 weeks for bottle feeding and weaning. When I got him he was a little underweight but otherwise healthy and about 3 1/2 weeks old. I got him plumped up, clipped his nails, gave him a little extra socialization, and showed him how this whole wet food thing works. He was really a great bottle feeder, which was a nice change because Morgana was all crazy paws. Lol. He did manage to bite off and eat a bottle nipple though, which was a bit nerve wracking, but it turned out okay.
