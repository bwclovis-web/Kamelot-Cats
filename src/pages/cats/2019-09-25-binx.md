  Binx was my very first foster kitten! It was a rather unusual foster situation
  because I was fostering for a couple who found him and wanted  to keep him but
  didn't have enough time to bottle feed a kitten so I only had him for about 2
  weeks for bottle feeding and weaning.

 When I got him he was a little underweight but otherwise healthy and about 3 1/2 weeks old. I got him plumped up, clipped his nails, gave him a little extra socialization, and showed him how this whole wet food thing works. He was really a great bottle feeder, which was a nice change because Morgana was all crazy paws. Lol.
