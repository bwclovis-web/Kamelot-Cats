![Test](/img/20190507_001726.jpg "Test")

I was one of those people who had no real idea what I wanted to do. I mean, I had some ideas but nothing that really motivated me or gave me a sense of purpose. I had finally settled on psychology, even though the amount of student loan debt associated with it was daunting when something happened that changed my life forever. 

One early May night my husband and I were watching TV when we heard tiny mews. We listened for a bit, thinking that mom cat was probably not too far and not wanting to snatch her baby away, but after an hour we still heard tiny kitten cries so we set off to search. The year before we had found a 4 week-ish old Arthur under our deck so that was the first place we checked, but nothing. Eventually we figured out that she was actually in our wall!

Luckily she was basically under an old doorbell box in the wall screwed out but there was still the matter of figuring out exactly where she was and how to get her out. After some creative use of a cell phone camera and a lot of trial and error I finally saw a little furry face peaking out of a nook all the way at the bottom, so I shoved my whole arm into the little hole in the wall and gently coaxed her into my hand. She was so cold! Ever so gently I twisted and turned so I could get my arm out of the wall while protecting this little kitten, and finally I emerged triumphant! I had saved a kitten!

Then I took a good look at this little, cold kitten I was holding. She was SO tiny! Her eyes were only just starting to open up! In that moment I realized two things. First, if she had been any bigger I wouldn't have been able to get her out of the wall without cutting through drywall (which I totally would've done) and second, I had no idea how to take care of a kitten this young. Overnight all I could do was make sure she was warm but first thing the next morning I rushed out to get her a bottle and kitten formula and took her to the vet for a checkup. 

The vet said she looked good and gave me advice on how to care for her, but halfway through the first day I realized I had questions that I hadn't thought to  ask. So I did what we all do. I asked Google! Luckily for me (and Morgana) Google directed me to The Kitten Lady's YouTube channel. The next week of my life was kitten care and binge watching because two days in she came down with an upper respiratory infection, an eye infection, and bad diarrhea which turned out to be coccidia. She pulled through though!

Via discovering The Kitten Lady I also discovered the plight of the kitten in our country, and that working with cats and kittens was an actual job you can have. Then I binge watched My Cat From Hell and realized that this is what I should be doing. I saved a tiny neonatal kitten who would have died without me and I can save more lives, help people have better relationships with their cats, and make the world a little better one life at a time. 

So I decided that becoming a cat trainer and fostering kittens are going to be the first steps in a larger plan towards helping cats!
