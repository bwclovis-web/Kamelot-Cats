On Sunday I went to my first ever cat convention, Catsbury Park Cat Convention! I'll be honest, initially the only reason I wanted to go was because The Kitten Lady was going to be there, but what I found when I arrived was a whole community of cat advocates. Everyone I met was warm and welcoming. They were genuinely thrilled that I had joined the community. It was so encouraging to meet so many wonderful people who love and want to help cats and kittens as much as I do. 

There were tons of vendor booths, every one of them selling something cute or tasty for you or your cats to raise money to save more cats and kittens. It was a cornucopia of wonderful cat goodies! I personally left with some kitten lady merch, a super comfy tee from the cat photographer, a zip down hoodie from homeward bound, delicious cat shaped chocolates, two bags of catnip, and a Toasty Cat bed which Lancelot claimed almost immediately. I also got my copy of Tiny but Mighty signed!

 I also visited the adoption lounge which was filled with adorable kittens and a few cats, many of whom went home that day! It was so hard not to bring home a tiny grey kitten from homeward bound, but alas, I already have 4 cats and I don't know where I would put another little box. The lounge itself was actually a catio built by Catio Bob, and it was really cool. I had never actually seen a catio in person before, and the kittens loved it! They were playing and napping on all the shelves and making friends with kitty and human alike. 

There were lots of talks and meet and greetgreets going on all day and I caught several of them. There were more that I wanted to attend but I hit traffic and could not find room 2. Lol. I did catch The Cat Photographer's talk, which was awesome, so you guys are going to start getting better pictures soon! I also attended The Kitten Lady's talk (of course) and it was informative, fun, and humorous. I also was at the Q&A panel at the end, which was great! It was more like a conversation than a lecture and I had a few of my own questions answered. 

I mentioned meet and greets, and while they all looked awesome the one I had tickets for was to meet The Kitten Lady! I was so excited for this and I was not disappointed! She is such a warm person, and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to meet her and tell her in person how she changed my life. 

I went for The Kitten Lady but I also found my people. I found a whole community that welcomed me with open arms and I instantly felt like I belonged. If you are an advocate, shelter or rescue worker, foster parent, or you just really love cats I 100% recommended going to a cat convention. I will definitely be going to more of them!
