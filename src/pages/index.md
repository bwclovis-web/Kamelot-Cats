  Hello world! My name is Amanda and I rescue kittens! I'm also going to school
  to be a cat trainer! I live in southern New Jersey but I've lived in other
  places and I love to travel. Right now I'm at the beginning of my journey but
  if you come along for the ride you'll find out lots of interesting tidbits
  about cats and kittens, see a lot of adorable kitten pictures, see pictures of
  cats in cool places around the world, find out about adoptable kittens, and
  more!

      out for future adoptable kittens!
